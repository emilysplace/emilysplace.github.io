<p class="font_7" dir="ltr">
  Emily&#8217;s Place is a small hometown coffee shoppe with lots of character. We strive to make everyone feel welcomed and at home.  Our goal is to reach the community for Christ one cup at a time. We love our customers and the friendships we have formed.

<p class="font_7" dir="ltr">
        Our journey began back in 2011 when we bought an old run down bakery and had visions of a gathering place for the community&#8230;..the coffee shoppe idea was born. It took us over two years to revamp the old bakery into what it is today. Our doors opened on April 22, 2013. We poured our hearts and souls into making it exactly what we had invisioned. We believe that when you walk in the front door you know exactly who we are and what we stand for. We look forward to many many years of serving our community that we grew up in and now choose to raise our children in.
